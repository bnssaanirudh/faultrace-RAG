# FaultTrace-RAG

## Counterfactual Fault Localization for Corpus-Level LLM Analytics Pipelines

FaultTrace-RAG addresses a fundamental challenge in LLM-based analytics: when a pipeline produces a wrong answer over a corpus, **which component failed?** Was it the retrieval scope (wrong evidence set R), fact extraction (incorrect E), aggregation logic (wrong A), or an interaction among these?

### Research Problem

Given a corpus-level query Q and a pipeline producing answer A* != A_gold, FaultTrace-RAG computes:

- **Scope Error (R)**: Did the pipeline retrieve the wrong records?
- **Extraction Error (E)**: Did it extract incorrect structured facts?
- **Aggregation Error (A)**: Did it compute the aggregate incorrectly?
- **Interaction Effects**: R x E, R x A, E x A, R x E x A combinations

By systematically replacing each component with a deterministic oracle, the system attributes recoverable errors and issues coverage certificates.

## Demo Path

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click **Start Demo** on the overview page
3. Navigate to **Corpus Worlds** to browse generated records
4. Open **Query Library** and pick any question
5. Click **Run Baseline** to execute the deterministic P0 pipeline
6. Navigate to **Trace Inspector** to see stage-by-stage trace

## Current Milestone: Prompt 6

Implements deterministic Track M data generation, procedural query factory, dual gold engine, deterministic baseline pipeline (P0), real LLM providers (P1-P5), Map-Extract-Reduce compound systems, exact Counterfactual Attribution Engine (Shapley), and Selective Prediction Certification Engine. All computational components, backends, and metrics are fully built and verified. Next step is wiring Dashboards and Visualization (Prompt 7).
