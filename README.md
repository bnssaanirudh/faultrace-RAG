## 📖 Overview

FaultTrace-RAG addresses a fundamental challenge in LLM-based analytics: when a pipeline produces a wrong answer over a corpus, **which component failed?** Was it the retrieval scope (wrong evidence set R), fact extraction (incorrect E), aggregation logic (wrong A), or an interaction among these?

By systematically replacing each component with a deterministic oracle (using our dual DuckDB/Pandas gold engine), FaultTrace-RAG attributes recoverable errors and issues **Coverage Certificates** for LLM pipeline outputs.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Counterfactual Attribution Engine:** Pinpoints exactly where an LLM failed using Shapley values across Retrieval, Extraction, and Aggregation stages.
- **Dual Gold Evaluation Engine:** Verifies ground-truth query answers against deterministic Pandas and DuckDB evaluations (100% parity validated).
- **Selective Prediction Certification:** Issues mathematical coverage certificates indicating whether an LLM's answer is trustable based on lexical ambiguity and trace evidence.
- **Advanced Graph Neural Extraction (GNN):** Parses structural scientific corpora (e.g. Springer ToC) into localized knowledge graphs using `torch_geometric`.
- **Multi-Track Synthetic Corpora:** Includes full synthetic data pipelines for Amazon Reviews (Track M) and Semantic Geoparsing (Track T).
- **Interactive Next.js Trace Inspector:** Deep dive into LLM context chunks, extraction traces, and tie-breaking policies.
- **Experiment Runner & R Diagnostics:** Run YAML-based specification sweeps and automatically output academic publication plots (accuracy-degradation, Shapley bootstraps) using `ggplot2` and `boot`.
- **Enterprise Security:** Hardened FastAPI backend with CORS, CSP, HSTS, rate-limiting, and path-traversal prevention.

## 🏗️ Architecture

FaultTrace-RAG consists of a distributed architecture centered around decoupling execution from evaluation.

- **`apps/api` (FastAPI):** Python backend serving standard endpoints for worlds, datasets, query generations, and pipeline traces.
- **`apps/web` (Next.js):** React frontend using TailwindCSS and App Router to visualize pipeline metrics and traces.
- **`packages/core`:** Pure Python models, pydantic schemas, and immutable data structures.
- **`packages/gold`:** Dual-engine (DuckDB + Pandas) baseline for deterministic query execution.
- **`packages/reporting`:** Automated academic figure generation (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and metric export.

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Assurance

FaultTrace-RAG includes a rigorous test suite to guarantee correctness.

```bash
make typecheck   # Mypy and TypeScript strict checks
make lint        # Ruff and ESLint
make test        # Pytest backend suite (Coverage 85%+)
make smoke       # Playwright End-to-End browser tests
```

## 📊 Generating Reports

To benchmark hardware runs and generate academic figures (SVGs and CSVs with watermarks):

```bash
# Sweep experiments across datasets (Amazon, Springer)
python scripts/sweep_attribution.py
python scripts/sweep_springer_oracle.py
python scripts/run_track_t.py

# Generates diagnostic R figures in the `artifacts/figures/` folder
Rscript scripts/generate_plots.R
Rscript scripts/compute_bootstrap_ci.R
```
